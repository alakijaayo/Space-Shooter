# Space-Shooter

Continuing my understanding and development using the Unity3D engine and learning how to use C# to build and create games. In this, I will be using the tutorial on the [Unity website](https://unity3d.com/learn/tutorials/s/space-shooter-tutorial) to build a Space shooter game.

In it, I will learn how to build a top-down space shooter model, importing the assets needed, setting up the basic player object and letting it react with other objects in the scene and making it move. We will use C# to build a game controller, which will control our game, spawn hazards in waves, count and display score and manage how we end and when we can restart the game.
